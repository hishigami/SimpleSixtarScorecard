# SimpleSixtarScorecard
This is a simple C# WinForms app to record Sixtar Gate: STARTRAIL scores, created by Bluehill from the Sixtar Gate Minor Gallery on dcinside.
I've only translated most of the program's hangul into English, though the username entry window's buttons still remain in Korean. Until I hack a way to localize them, 확인 = OK and 취소 = Cancel.

All other quirks with the program still remain as-is. Try not to kill the program with Task Manager as it will only save records upon closing the program normally.

.NET 8.0 Runtime is required to run this app.
